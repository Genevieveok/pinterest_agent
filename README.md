# Pinterest Agent — Complete (Hybrid Replicate' + Local Fallback) (WIP)
This tool provides an automated way to manage Pinterest content. Design facilitates pinning new images directly from a blog and repinning existing, high-performing content from other boards. Continuous activity helps drive engagement on Pinterest and, consequently, increases referral traffic to the blog.

This repo automates Pinterest activity:
- Repin 5 pins/day (niche-focused) (WIP)
  - Pin sourcing is currently restricted to content within the authorized user's account (e.g., searching the user's own boards).
  - The next priority is resolving the API limitation that prevents global pin discovery, specifically by finding the correct method or endpoint to retrieve random, trending, or explore-feed pins.
- Create 2 new SEO-friendly aesthetic pins/day (1 generated by **Replicate (SDXL Turbo)**, 1 blog-image overlay)
- Hosts generated images in `gh-pages` branch via GitHub Contents API (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Runs on GitHub Actions (daily cron)
- Persists state in SQLite (ignored by .gitignore)

Setup (summary)
1. Fork/push this repo to GitHub.
2. In GitHub repo Settings → Secrets → Actions add:
   - `PINTEREST_APP_ID` (required)
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (provided by Actions; ensure repo write access)
   - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` (optional — set for image generation)
   - `SITE_URL`
   - `BOARD_K_DRAMA`, `BOARD_C_DRAMA`, `BOARD_ENTERTAINMENT`, `BOARD_LIFESTYLE`, `BOARD_FOOD`, `BOARD_TRAVEL`
   - `IMAGE_HOST_BRANCH` (optional, default: gh-pages)
3. Confirm `agent/boards.yml` contains placeholders (it does by default).
4. Trigger workflow manually or wait for cron.

Local testing
- Create `.env` with the same keys as above for local runs (ensure `.env` is in .gitignore).
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run locally: `python -m agent.main` (be careful to not spam Pinterest API in tests)
